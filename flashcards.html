        <p>People are learning new vocabulary everyday. But learning a new language from scratch is hard and if you have a busy life, it's hard to find time to learn.</p>
        <p>During the UX fundamentals course of Careerfoundry, I designed a vocabulary app. A way to empower people to learn new languages.</p>

    <!--Problem statement-->
    <section>
      <div class="wrapper endsection">
        <h1 class="blue">Discovery</h1>
        <p>I started the process by doing research. One way to learn vocabulary is by using flashcards. A flashcard is a card containing a small amount of information - an easy aid when learning a language.</p>
        <p>Flashcards apps are very popular, but what I saw in my research is that most of these apps were targeted at students and kids. While flashcards are a great way to cram up new words, it also felt like the learning itself could be a bit boring.</p>

    <!--User research-->
    <section class="wrapper endsection">
      <h2>Persona</h2>
      <p>In the user interviews, I learned that all my users had a personal reason to learn a language. Some of them where expats now living in the Netherlands, others had roots in foreign countries and because of that they had a great interest in learning
        the language. All of them found it hard the learn a language. Based on the user interviews I created a persona.</p>

      <h1 class="blue">Concept</h1>
      <h2>User flows</h2>
      <p>With the user in mind, I created user flows for the language learning app. I wanted to use flashcards for learning the vocabulary. While flashcards are useful when you’re cramming the words, cramming words itself isn’t the most fun thing to do –
        it is just something that needs to be done if you’re learning a language. As the user wants to have interesting topics and wants the learning to be fun, I came up with the following lesson structure: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A fun movie for introducing the topics</li>
        <li>Flashcards to learn and cram the words</li>
        <li>A quiz to test yourself and to see that you are improving.</li>
      </ul>
      <!--Pictures of the flows-->
    </section>

    <section class="wrapper endsection">
      <h2>Wireframing and paper prototyping</h2>
      <p>Based on the user flows, I started making wireframes. First, I created some quick sketches of the wireframes. Then I selected the best ideas, which I improved even further. When I was satisfied with the result, I made the wireframes into a prototype
        using Prott. I prepared an usability test plan, so I could test the most important features of the app with the users. Key learnings usability tests:- The users where happy with the lesson structure.- The navigation of flashcards feature was
        confusing for the user, not knowing how it works or how to go to the next card. Based on these findings, I improved my wireframes and prototype further.</p>
