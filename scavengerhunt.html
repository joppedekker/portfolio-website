      <h1 class="blue">Overview</h1>
      <p>Hidden gems is a mobile scavenger hunt app. The app is designed for people who want go off the beaten path and (re)discover the city they are in together with friends and family. The functionalities will give the users a way to immerse themselves
        in their city by playing and creating scavenger hunts.​​​​​​​</p>

    <!--Problem statement-->
    <section class="wrapper endsection">
      <h1 class="blue">Discovery</h1>
      <h2>Problem statement</h2>
      <p>I started by researching the topic: What are scavenger hunts? What would users expect out of a scavenger hunt app? I quickly realised that when I was playing a scavenger hunt, I wanted to discover the city I'm in and go to new places. But some scavengerhunt
        games, like Pokémon Go, always seem to take you to the same places.</p>
      <p>Based on this, I came up with the following problem statement:</p>
      <p>Our scavenger hunt app users need a way to quickly set up a new, fun, and interesting scavenger hunt in their area with locations that really spark their interest because they wish to go off-the-beaten-path and (re)discover the area they’re in together
        with friends and family in a fun way.</p>
      <p>We will know this to be true when we see how many scavenger hunt app users are using our app to explore the area they’re in.</p>
    </section>

    <!--Competitive analysis-->
    <section class="wrapper endsection">
      <h2>Competitive analysis</h2>
      <p>To get more insight on what a scavenger hunt app could be, a competitive analysis was done on two scavenger hunt apps. By finding out their key objectives, strategies, strength and weaknesses, I was able to understand the market I was designing
        for better. </p>
    </section>

    <!--User research-->
    <section class="wrapper endsection">
      <h2>User research</h2>
      <p>User interviews were conducted with four different persons. The goal was getting to know what kind of places they have interest in and what their experiences are with playing and creating scavenger hunts. All the information I got during the user
        interviews was mapped and sorted using affinity mapping.</p>

      <h3>Insights</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Users want to discover new places and city together with friends</li>
        <li>A competitive element in the game is important and a multiplayer game would be interesting.</li>
        <li>Users want to create their own hunt but need some kind of guidance to easily make a hunt.</li>
      </ul>

    <!--Personas and user journeys-->
    <section class="wrapper endsection">
      <h2>Personas and user journeys</h2>
      <p>When you look at the experience that different people have with scavenger hunt apps, there seems to be a hierarchy between the different users. A user that just started using the app could become a more fanatic player in the future. And with the
        right information on creating a hunt and the right guidance, a fanatic player could eventually evolve into a hunt creator. With this information in mind, I created 3 personas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The explorer</li>
        <li>The fanatic player</li>
        <li>The creator</li>
      </ul>

    <!--Revised problem statement & hypothesis-->
    <section class="wrapper endsection">
      <h2>Revised problem statement</h2>
      <p><i>Our scavenger hunt app users need a way to go off-the-beaten-path and (re)discover the city they are in together with friends and family because they want to be immersed in their own city.</i></p>
      <p><i>We will know this to be true when we see how many scavenger hunt app users are using our app to explore the area they're in.</i></p>

        <div class="column-3">

          <p>We believe that by creating an “easy exploration mode” for Claire, we will achieve that Claire increases her knowledge on interesting places in the city with 30%</p>

    <!--User flows-->
    <section class="wrapper endsection">
      <h1 class="blue">Concept</h1>
      <h2>User flows</h2>
      <p>With the personas and their user journeys in mind, I created user flows for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Playing an explorer hunt</li>
        <li>Playing a multiplayer hunt</li>
        <li>Creating a hunt</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="wrapper endsection">
      <h2>Wireframes</h2>
      <p>Based on the user flows and with the created sitemap in mind, I started creating wireframes on paper. By making quick sketches, it is easy get to see what works and what doesn’t work. Ideas can be easily checked with users and stakeholders. This
        really helped me to optimize the user flows even further. The wireframes were constantly refined after getting feedback from users and stakeholders. Mid-fidelity wireframes were made in Balsamiq and worked out further into high-fidelity wireframes
        in Sketch. With the high-fidelity wireframes, I made a prototype in InVision.</p>

      <!--User testing and results-->
      <h1 class="blue">Prototyping and User testing</h1>
      <h2>User testing</h2>
      <p>A moderated in-person usability test was performed with 5 participants. The goal of the test was to see how new users interact with the scavenger hunt app for the first time on mobile. To observe and measure if the users understand the app, it’s
        value and how to complete most important features: playing a hunt and creating a hunt</p>

      <h3>Test Objectives</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Determine if participants understand what the app is about quickly and easily (i.e., an application to explore your own city) and the value it provides.</li>
        <li>Observe and determine how easy the can users navigate and start playing a scavenger hunt in Hidden Gems</li>
        <li>Observe how the users experience a multiplayer hunt in Hidden Gems</li>
        <li>Observe how and determine how easy the users can create and organize a scavenger hunts in Hidden Gems</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The tests led to some valuable insights on navigation in the app. Also, the multiplayer hunt made the participants really excited - even though there were some things that didn't work as they liked, they all thought it would be a fun and interesting
        scavenger hunt game to play. With all the insights from the user tests and feedback from peers, I reiterated the designs, improving the navigation, the designs and it's accessibility even further.</p>
